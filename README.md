### [04/16/2021]
#### Thank you everyone who gave this app a shot, it's been a great learning opportunity for me!
#### Unfortunately, I won't be able to continue maintaining G-Desktop-Suite due to time constraints. However, this repository is open to new lead maintainers! If you're interested, shoot me an email at alexgkim205@gmail.com.

Have you ever wished you had a no-frills, word-processing desktop app dedicated to just Google Drive? Annoyed at having to click the Go to My Drive button everytime you visit [https://drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com)? Want a Microsoft Word-esque experience for your Google Drive? Or simply looking to separate Google Drive from the other bajillion tabs that you opened for your research paper? Look no further!

G Desktop Suite is a desktop wrapper for Google Drive built with [ElectronJS](https://github.com/electron/electron). Give it a try, and if you like what you see, share it with your friends!
